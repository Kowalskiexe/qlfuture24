# QLFuture 2024

[event's website](https://qlfuture.eu/)

This repository contains some of the files I created during
the QLFuture Quantum Hackathon organized at [Future
Labs](https://futurelabs.psnc.pl/), a part of the Poznan
Supercomputing and Networking Center.

Our team, `QQrydza`, participated in topic #5 (diagnosis
detection), aiming to enhance clustering algorithms for
machine learning using quantum computers.

We didn't secure a podium position but we had a blast
participating, also we've learned a lot about quantum
computing and machine learning.

Feel free to check out our [presentation](./QQrydza_slideshow.pdf).

Best regards to the organizers, much love <3
